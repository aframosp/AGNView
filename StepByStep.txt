## We need to re-run the code to have a similar grid of values in the Fritz AGN module

1) Create the Database Sample (Obtain_Seyfert_Samples)
    1.1) Obtain a list of Seyfert galaxies from Simbad TAP => SMB_3Dec.fits
    1.2) Use TOPCAT to cross-match SIMBAD galaxies and VCV Galaxies => SMB_VCV.fits
    1.3) Obtain the bibcodes for the otype classifications in Simbad => BibcodesOtypes.fits
    1.4) Present another solution the previous steps
2) Clean the Seyfert Sample (Clean_Sample)
    2.1) Remove different redshifts
    2.2) Separate the origin of the bibcode
    2.3) Dealing with UNK bibcodes and Seyfert Types
    2.4) Dealing with emission origin with UNK bibcode
    2.5) Create the final sample of galaxies in terms of redshift and bibcodes =>VCV_TAP_otypes.txt
    2.6) Calculate the final numbers from the otypes
3) Obtain the SEDs for Database Sample (Obtain_SEDs)
    3.1) Get SEDs from CDS = CDSVotables, and NED = NEDVotables with their respective bibcodes and eliminating duplicate measurements 
    3.2) Select photometric filters/bands
    3.3) Save SEDs = SEDs => *_Phot.txt
4) Create CIGALE Photometry file for Database Sample (Create_CIGALEPhot)
    4.1) Create equivalencies between NED and CDS tables
    4.2) Transform photometry to CIGALE table
    4.3) Clean photometry points for a minimum of 2% and a maximum of 33%. 
    4.4) Remove galaxies taking into account energy balance, at least 2 IR bands and 5 Opt bands
    4.5) Separating galaxies at different redshifts: Below 0.5, between 0.5 and 1, and above 1
    4.6) Create CIGALE photometry files => CIGPhot_EnergyBal_Lowz.tbl,CIGPhot_EnergyBal_Intz.tbl,CIGPhot_EnergyBal_Highz.tbl
5) Run CIGALE = Peregrine, parameters in TABLE 2
    5.1) Run Fritz models Fr
    5.2) Run SKIRTOR models SK
    5.3) Run Fritz and SKIRTOR models but only with two angles 30 and 70.
    5.4) Run Fr and SK for fAGN=0, should have the same results

## Fixing contents
4) Calculate the initial numbers of the sample used (InitNumbers)
    4.1) Numbers for VCV and SMB
    4.2) Numbers from photometry
6) Basic results from CIGALE
    6.1) Join all redshift files (JoinCleanCIGALE)
        6.1.1) Join Low, Intermediate and High-z runs in one table
        6.1.2) Red-chi-square distributions FIGURE 2
                Running median Red-chi-sq (x-axis) and FAGN (y-axes), with the distribution in a adjacent subplot
        6.1.3) Clean good fits and save files => Cleanresults_*.fits
        6.1.4) Calculate the counts for galaxy type TABLE 3 
    6.2) Example SEDs for SKIRTOR and Fritz FIGURE 1 (ExampleSED)
        6.2.1) Select best galaxy, expected to have it for all the SEDs
        6.2.2) Figure with the 4 SEDs 
7) Pre-Analyse 
    7.1) Join clean results
    7.2) Experiment the best parameters assuming the SMB classification
        7.2.1) Remove parameters that are not useful
        7.2.2) Use GridSearch CV to find parameters
8) Analyse the results with Tables (Analysis_Tables)
    8.1) Join clean results
    8.2) Calculate the correlation-scores of the inclination type with angle TABLE 4
    8.3) Apply feature selection (RFECV) to use only the ones that we need for the analysis
    8.4) Predict classifications with ML-algorithms and compare TABLE 5
    8.5) Predict classifications ofr S and SyG type galaxies TABLE 6
9) Analyse the results with Plots (Analysis_Plot)
    9.1) Join clean results
    9.2) Compare physical parameters from Fritz and SKIRTOR models FIGURE 3
            Selected parameters (x-axes) compared between normalized (y-axes) models (colors), with errors (second row)
    9.3) Compare difference in physical parameters; Stellar mass, FAGN, inclination, AGN luminosity with Type IMPORTANT FIGURE
        9.3.1) Compare with both SMB and VCV classifications so Type1=S1 and Type2=S2 FIGURE 4
        9.3.2) Compare the classifications also with the 30/70 model FIGURE ALT 4
    9.4) Other VCV classifications as S1.0, S1.2, S1.5, S1.8, S1.9 FIGURE 5 in SKIRTOR
    9.5) Otypes classifications as X-ray, IR and Radio FIGURE 6 in SKIRTOR
    9.6) Redshift change histogram and AGN luminosities FIGURE 7
