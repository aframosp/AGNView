StepByStep file

This works a Table of contents (TOC) to follow the procedures done to reproduce the information presented in the paper.
Is important to keep in mind that some of the steps are not going to be in the GitHub repository (For example Step 5,
where we run the CIGALE modelling in a computer cluster). 
The numbers of this TOC will be the same as in the Jupyter notebooks.

Some important clarrifications are the following:

TOC
1) Create the Database Sample (Obtain_Seyfert_Samples)
    1.1) Obtain a list of Seyfert galaxies from Simbad TAP => SMB_3Dec.fits
    1.2) Use TOPCAT to cross-match SIMBAD galaxies and VCV Galaxies => SMB_VCV.fits
    1.3) Obtain the bibcodes for the otype classifications in Simbad => BibcodesOtypes.fits
    1.4) Present another solution the previous steps
2) Clean the Seyfert Sample (Clean_Sample)
    2.1) Remove different redshifts
    2.2) Separate the origin of the bibcode
    2.3) Dealing with UNK bibcodes and Seyfert Types
    2.4) Dealing with emission origin with UNK bibcode
    2.5) Create the final sample of galaxies in terms of redshift and bibcodes =>VCV_TAP_otypes.txt
    2.6) Calculate the final numbers from the otypes
3) Obtain the SEDs for Database Sample (Obtain_SEDs)
    3.1) Get SEDs from CDS = CDSVotables, and NED = NEDVotables with their respective bibcodes and
         eliminating duplicate measurements 
    3.2) Select photometric filters/bands
    3.3) Save SEDs = SEDs => *_Phot.txt
4) Create CIGALE Photometry file for Database Sample (Create_CIGALEPhot)
    4.1) Create equivalencies between NED and CDS tables
    4.2) Transform photometry to CIGALE table
    4.3) Clean photometry points for a minimum of 2% and a maximum of 33%. 
    4.4) Remove galaxies taking into account energy balance, at least 2 IR bands and 5 Opt bands
    4.5) Separating galaxies at different redshifts: Below 0.5, between 0.5 and 1, and above 1
    4.6) Create CIGALE photometry files => CIGPhot_EnergyBal_Lowz.tbl,CIGPhot_EnergyBal_Intz.tbl,
         CIGPhot_EnergyBal_Highz.tbl
5) Run CIGALE = Peregrine, parameters in TABLE 2
    5.1) Run Fritz models Fr
    5.2) Run SKIRTOR models SK
    5.3) Run Fritz and SKIRTOR models but only with two angles 30 and 70.
    5.4) Run Fr and SK for fAGN=0, should have the same results
6) Calculate the initial numbers of the sample used (Initial_Numbers)
    6.1) Numbers from photometry TABLE 1
    6.2) Numbers from VCV
    6.3) Numbers from SMB
    6.4) Numbers in both SMB and VCV, part of the values for TABLE 3 
7) Join and clean CIGALE results (Clean_CIGALE_results)
    7.1) Join Low, Intermediate and High-z runs in one table
    7.2) Red-chi-square distributions FIGURE 2
            Running median Red-chi-sq (x-axis) and FAGN (y-axes), with the distribution in a adjacent subplot
    7.3) Cleaning and save files => Cleanresults_*.fits
    7.4) Calculate the counts for galaxy type TABLE 3 
8) Example SEDs for SKIRTOR and Fritz (SED_Plots)
    8.1) Select best and worst SED fittings
    8.2) Plot the 4 SEDs for the best galaxy FIGURE 1 and the worst galaxy   
9) Pre-Analyse of data
    9.1) Join clean results
    9.2) Experiments with the parameters of the classifiers, assuming the SMB classification
    9.3) Use GridSearchCV to find parameters for the classifiers

10) Analyse the results with Tables (Analysis_Tables)
    10.1) Join clean results
    10.2) Calculate the correlation-scores of the inclination type with angle TABLE 4

    10.4) Predict classifications with ML-algorithms and compare TABLE 5
    10.5) Predict classifications ofr S and SyG type galaxies TABLE 6
11) Analyse the results with Plots (Analysis_Plot)
