## We need to re-run the code to have a similar grid of values in the Fritz AGN module

1) Create the Database Sample (ObtainSamples)
    1.1) Obtain a list of Seyfert galaxies from TAP Simbad => SMB_3Dec.fits
    1.2) Use TOPCAT to cross-match SIMBAD galaxies and VCV Galaxies => SMB_VCV.fits
    1.3) Obtain the bibcodes for the otype classifications in Simbad => BibcodesOtypes.fits
    1.4) We clean the file with the final sample of galaxies in terms of redshift and bibcodes (CleanSMBVCV) =>VCV_TAP_otypes.txt
2) Obtain the SEDs for Database Sample (Obtain_SEDs)
    2.1) Get SEDs from CDS = CDSVotables
    2.2) Get SEDs from NED = NEDVotables
    2.3) Add Bibcode to CDS tables
    2.4) Eliminate duplicate measurements 
    2.5) Select photometry filters and average measurements for NED and CDS
    2.6) Save SEDs = SEDs => *_Phot.txt
3) Create CIGALE Photometry file for Database Sample (CreateCIGALEPhot)
    3.1) Create equivalencies between NED and CDS tables
    3.2) Clean photometry
        3.2.1) Remove radio wavelengths
        3.2.2) Clean photometry points for a minimum of 2% and a maximum of 33%. 
        3.2.3) Remove galaxies taking into account energy balance, at least 2 IR bands and 5 Opt bands
    3.3) Save galaxies at different redshifts: Below 0.5, between 0.5 and 1, and above 1
    3.4) Create CIGALE photometry files => CIGPhot_EnergyBal_Lowz.tbl,CIGPhot_EnergyBal_Intz.tbl,CIGPhot_EnergyBal_Highz.tbl
4) Calculate the initial numbers of the sample used (InitNumbers)
    4.1) Numbers for VCV adn TAP
    4.2) Numbers from photometry
5) Run CIGALE = Peregrine, parameters in TABLE 2
    5.1) Run Fritz models Fr
    5.2) Run SKIRTOR models SK
    5.3) Run Fritz and SKIRTOR models but only with two angles 30 and 70.
    5.4) Run Fr and SK for fAGN=0, should have the same results
6) Basic results from CIGALE
    6.1) Join all redshift files (JoinCleanCIGALE)
        6.1.1) Join Low, Intermediate and High-z runs in one table
        6.1.2) Red-chi-sq distributions FIGURE 2
                Runing median Red-chi-sq (x-axis) and FAGN (y-axes), with the distribution in a adjacent subplot
        6.1.3) Clean good fits and save files => Cleanresults_*.fits
        6.1.4) Calculate the counts for galaxy type TABLE 3 
    6.2) Example SEDs for SKIRTOR and Fritz FIGURE 1 (ExampleSED)
        6.2.1) Select best galaxy, expected to have it for all the SEDs
        6.2.2) Figure with the 4 SEDs 
7) Analyze the results with Plots (Analysis_Plot)
    7.1) Compare physical parameters fron Fritz and SKIRTOR models FIGURE 3
            Selected parameters (x-axes) compared between normalized (y-axes) models (colors), with errors (second row)
    7.2) Compare difference in physical parameters; Stellar mass, FAGN, inclination, AGN luminosity with Type IMPORTANT FIGURE
        7.2.1) Compare with both TAP and VCV classifications so Type1=S1 and Type2=S2 FIGURE 4
        7.2.2) Compare the classifications also with the 30/70 model FIGURE ALT 4
    7.3) Other VCV classifications as S1.0, S1.2, S1.5, S1.8, S1.9 FIGURE 5 in SKIRTOR
    7.4) Otypes classifications as X-ray, IR and Radio FIGURE 6 in SKIRTOR
    7.5) Redshift change histrogram and AGN luminosities FIGURE 7
8) Analyze the results with Tables (Analysis_Tables)
    8.1) Calculate the correlation-scores of the inclination type with angle TABLE 4
    8.2) Predict Type with RandomForest and compare TABLE 5
    8.3) Predict S and SyG type galaxies TABLE 6
9) Start writting ... and read papers
10) Add all the information/data in Zenodo and Github
    
?1.4) Find all NeV/NeII in the SIMBAD sample (AGN_with_NeV_Obtain) => AllSeyfertNeon.tbl
    ?1.4.1) Create a file for NED galaxy names => NameNED.txt
    ?1.4.2) Use NED and Simbad information to remove duplicates => GalaxiesWithNeVNeII.txt 
?5.5) Check results with [Ne V]/[Ne II]  old FIGURE 7 ?
?5.6) Check overlap between them and with Ramos Padilla 2020 old FIGURE 8 ?    
?4) Create the HELP Sample
    4.1) Obtain galaxies of the largest field on HELP, Herschel-82
    4.2) Use TOPCAT to match VCV_TAP with galaxies in HELP, clean in terms of redshift => HELP_VCV_TAP.txt
?5) Create CIGALE Photometry file for HELP Sample (CreateCIGALEPhotHELP)=> CIGALEPhotHELP.tbl
