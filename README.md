# AGNView preparation/reproduction repository

=======

This is a repository that I will use to prepare/reproduce the publication of a the AGN paper. 

For the moment I am writting the results sections, some re-runs in the notebooks are needed. I am using a different branch for these experiments. We are also organizing the table of contents and improving the code.

WARNING: At the moment the moment Python Markdown does not show the interactive results. Looking for a solution
